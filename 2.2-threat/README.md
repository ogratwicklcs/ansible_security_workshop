# Exercise 2.2 - Threat hunting

## Step 2.1 - The Background

Threat detection and response capabilities require from a security operator typically to deploy many tools to secure an enterprise IT. Due to missing processes and a lot of manual work this is a serious challenge to proper IT security operations!

## Step 2.2 - Preparations

For this exercise to work properly, the playbook `whitelist_attacker.yml` must have been run at least once. Also in the Check Point SmartConsole management interface the logging for the attacker whitelist policy must have been activated. Both was done in the Check Point exercise in section 1.2 . If you missed the steps, go back there, execute the playbook, follow the steps to activate the logging and come back here.

## Step 2.3 - Explore the Tower setup

There are two more steps needed for preparation - but in contrast to the previous exercise, we will use Tower to do them. Your Tower installation is already populated with users, inventory, credentials and so on, and can be used directly. Let's have a look at it: Tower is accessed via browser. You need the URL to your personal Tower instance. It is be similar to the URL for your VS Code online editor, but without the `-code`. You can also find it on your workshop page:

![Tower URL example](images/tower_url.png)

> **Note**
>
> This URL and login information are just an example. Your Tower URL and login information will be different.

Open your browser and enter the link to your Tower instance. Log-in with your student ID and the password provided to you. You are greeted with a dashboard and a navigation bar on the left side.

![Tower dashboard](images/tower_dashboard.png)

On the left side, click on **Templates**. A list of all already configured job templates are shown. A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job. It defines the inventory, credentials, playbook, limits, become rights and so on which are needed to execute the automation. In this list, find the entry called **Blacklist attacker**, and click on the rocket symbol right to it:

![Blacklist attacker](images/tower_blacklist.png)

This click will bring you to the job overview, showing live data from the automation job execution and a summary of all the parameters which are relevant to the job. With this automation execution we have changed the existing policy in the Firewall to drop packages between the two machines.

Now all we need is the attack. Unlike the last exercise we will not write and execute a playbook, but again use Tower to start the attack. In the navigation bar on the left side, click on **Templates**. In the list of templates, find and execute the one called **Start DDOS attack simulation** by clicking on the rocket icon right to it. This will ensure that every few seconds an attack is simulated.

The stage is set now. Read on to learn what this use case is about.

## Step 2.4 - See the attack

You are a security operator in charge of an enterprise firewall in a larger cooperaiton. You just found that a policy enforced by a Check Point Next Generation Firewall (NGFW), protecting your line of business applications, has been repeatedly violated. To showcase this, open the SmartConsole on your Windows workstation, access the Check Point management server and on the left side click on the **LOGS & MONITOR** tab. A new window opens, offering you two choices: **Audit Logs** and **Logs**. Click on **Logs** to get to the actual view of the logs:

![Check Point logs view, violation logs](images/smartconsole_violation_logs.png)

You can see, a series of messages with the description **http Traffic Dropped** there, repeating again and again over time.

> **Note**
>
> If you do not see any logs, auto refresh might not be activated. If that is the case, click on the corresponding button, an A next to a circle:

![Check Point logs view, auto refresh button](images/smartconsole_auto_refresh.png)

Seeing these violations we should start an investigation to assess if they are the outcome of an attack. The best way to investigate is to correlate the firewall logs with logs generated by other security solutions deployed in our network - like Snort - in a log management tool like QRadar.

## Step 2.5 - Forward logs to QRadar

Let's try this out. Once you have logged in to Ansible Tower, you can see the dashboard, navigate to **Templates**. 

Since we are the domain owners of the firewall, we can modify, delete and execute those job templates. Let's execute the template **Send firewall logs to QRadar** by clicking on the little rocket icon next to it. The execution of the job takes a few seconds. From the perspective of the firewall operator we have now reconfigured the firewall to send logs to the central SIEM.

However, the SIEM still needs to accept logs and sort them into proper streams, called log sources in QRadar. Let's switch our perspective to the one of the security analyst. We get a call that there is something weird in the firewall and that logs are already sent into our direction. Again, check out the **Templates**: again we have a different list of automation templates at our hand. Let's accept the firewall logs into our SIEM: Execute the job template **Accept firewall logs in QRadar**.

After a few seconds the playbook run through, and the new security configuration is done. In contrast to the previous exercise, none of these steps required the operator or the analyst to access the command line, write playbooks or even install roles or collections. The playbooks were pre-approved and in fact accessed from within a Git repository. Tower took care of the execution and the downloads of any role or collections. This substantially simplifies automation operations.

If you click on **Jobs** on the right side you will also see that you can always access the previously run jobs. This enables the teams to better track what was executed when, and what where the results. This enables transparency and clear understanding of the automation that was run.

## Step 2.6 - Verify new configuration

Let's quickly verify that the QRadar logs are now showing up. Log into the QRadar web UI. Click on **Log Activity** and verify that events are making it to QRadar from Check Point:

![QRadar Log Activity showing logs from Check Point](images/qradar_checkpoint_logs.png)

> **Note**
>
> If you do not see any logs coming in, click on the drop down menu next to **View** and select **Real Time (streaming)**.

If the logs get drowned in QRadar's own logs, create a filter. Or click on unwanted log lines in the column **Log Source**, and pick **Filter on Log Source is not ...** to create filters on the fly to filter out unwanted traffic.

Let's verify that QRadar also properly shows the log source. In the QRadar UI, click on the hamburger button in the left upper corner, and click on **Admin**. In there, click on **Log Souces**. A new window opens and shows the new log source.

## Step 2.7 - Add Snort rule

Let's add a new IDS rule. Again we will do this via a pre-approved playbook already in Tower. Log out of Tower, and log in as user `opsids` - the IDPS operator in charge of the IDPS. Navigate to **Templates**. There is a pre-created playbook available to add a rule to Snort. Execute it by clicking on the small rocket icon. But as you see, instead of bringing you to the jobs output, you will be faced with a survey:

![Ansible Tower survey](images/tower_snort_survey.png)

The playbook cannot run without further content - we have to provide the actual rule which needs to be deployed! Of course, with Snort, the rule necessary to be added depends on the actual use case and thus might be different each time. Thus this job template has a ***survey*** enabled, a method in Ansible Tower to query input before execution.

In this case we query the proper signature, the right Snort rule for this specific attack. Enter the following string into the field:

```
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Attempted DDoS Attack"; uricontent:"/ddos_simulation"; classtype:successful-dos; sid:99000010; priority:1; rev:1;)
```

As you can see we add a new snort rule matching on the parameters of the attack. In our example we again check for URI content. After you added the string, click on **Next** and then on **Launch**.

The playbook runs through, takes care of installing the new rule, restarting the service and so on.

Quickly verify the new rule on the Snort instance. From a terminal of your VS Code online editor, log in to Snort via SSH with the user `ec2user`:

```bash
[student<X>@ansible ~]$ ssh ec2-user@11.22.33.44
Last login: Fri Sep 20 15:09:40 2019 from 54.85.79.232
[ec2-user@snort ~]$ sudo grep ddos_simulation /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
alert tcp any any -> any any  (msg:"Attempted DDoS Attack"; uricontent:"/ddos_simulation"; classtype:successful-dos; sid:99000010; priority:1; rev:1;)
```


After you have verified the rule, leave the Snort server via the command `exit`.

Next we also want the IDPS to send logs to QRadar in case the rule has a hit. We could just execute a corresponding job template as the user `opsids`. But this time we want to take a different path: instead of the IDPS operator executing the prepared playbook, we want to show how Ansible Tower can delegate such execution rights to others without letting them take control of the domain.

In the **Templates** section there are multiple playbooks for a security analyst:

- **Accept firewall logs in QRadar**
- **Accept IDPS logs in QRadar**
- **Roll back all changes**
- **Send IDPS logs to QRadar**

Execute now both job templates **Accept IDPS logs in QRadar** and **Send IDPS logs to QRadar** by pressing the little rocket icon next to the job templates.

## Step 2.8 - Whitelist IP

Let's quickly have a look at our SIEM QRadar: access the log activity tab. Validate, that in QRadar **no** events from the IDS are generated. That way you know for sure that the anomaly you see is only caused by the single IP you have in the firewall. No other traffic is causing the anomaly, you can safely assume that the anomaly you see is a false positive.

> **Note**
>
> In reality you might perform additional steps analyzing the machines behavior to exclude the possibility that it has been compromised.

We have determined that the host is not performing an attack and finally confirmed that the firewall policy violation is a false positive, probably caused by a misconfiguration of the whitelist group for that application. So we can whitelist the IP in the firewall to let events come through.

Go to the **Templates** overview, and launch the job template **Whitelist attacker**. A few moments later the traffic is allowed.

## Step 2.9- Rollback

The analysts have ended their threat hunting. To reduce resource consumption and the analysis workload it is preferable to now rollback the Check Point and Snort log configurations back to their pre-investigation state. To do so, there is pre-approved job template available to the analysts:

- **Roll back all changes**

Log into Ansible Tower and execute it by clicking on the little rocket icon next to it. Soon all logging configuration is set back to normal.

Last but not least we have to stop the attack simulation. In the section **Templates**, find and execute the job template called **Stop DDOS attack simulation**.

You are done with the exercise. Turn back to the list of exercises to continue with the next one.
